___Where did you find the code and why did you choose it?

Link: https://github.com/ekzhang/dispict/blob/main/main.py
___Why I chose it: 
I wanted to study a real-life example of using deep learning + backend in a project. This code is interesting because it uses OpenAI’s CLIP model and connects it to a web endpoint, actual deployed AI.

___What does the program do? What’s the general structure?
___Big picture:
It processes 25,000 artworks from the Harvard Museum, gets CLIP embeddings (like vector math representations) of their images, and sets up a web API so you can search artworks using text descriptions and get matching images back, like "find art that looks like 'stormy night with horses'".

___Structure (rough outline):

CLIP setup – load the model, process text and images.

Image embedding – fetch each image from a URL and convert it to a 512-d vector.

Read metadata – reads artwork info from a JSON file.

Read/save embeddings – stores vectors into an HDF5 file.

Web endpoint – a Modal function you can call from a website or app.

Main entry point – embed_images() is for embedding all images if you run the script locally.

___Function analysis — let's zoom in on run_clip_images
___What does this function do?
It takes a list of image URLs, downloads each one, and returns CLIP image embeddings (vector representations). It also tracks which ones failed to download or process.

Inputs and outputs:
Input: image_urls → a list of image links.

Output:
→ missing_indices: list of image indexes that failed (download or error)
→ embeddings: a 2D NumPy array of shape (number of successful images, 512)

___How does it work? (step-by-step)
Uses requests.get() with retries to handle network errors.
Uses ThreadPoolExecutor to download images in parallel (fast!).
If an image can’t be opened (e.g., broken or not an image), it adds the index to missing_indices.
Preprocesses images using the CLIP model’s expected format.
Embeds all the preprocessed images using model.encode_image().
Returns both the missing indices and the actual vector results.

___What’s cool about it:
It’s robust (retries + error handling).
Uses multithreading for speed.
Separates failed downloads from successful ones, so later processing doesn’t crash.

___Takeaways (what I learned / want to steal)
- Using ThreadPoolExecutor is a clean way to parallelize I/O-heavy stuff like downloads.
- The use of environment variables (INSIDE) to control behavior in serverless environments is clever.
- Using @app.function from Modal helps create easy-to-deploy web functions — looks almost like writing normal Python functions but gets deployed to the cloud.
- Chunking a huge list into smaller pieces (for image processing) is super useful. Keeps memory and speed balanced.

___What was confusing or hard to get at first?
At first, I didn’t understand what clip_image and web_image were doing — they’re not normal variables. Later realized they’re Modal container images, like defining Docker containers with dependencies.

The way app.function(...) and @modal.web_endpoint() works is also a bit weird until you understand it’s part of Modal's cloud platform, not regular Python.
